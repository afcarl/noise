You can add noise models to the toolbox by creating versions of the relevant files. Once added, they can be tested using the `noiseTest`. For example you can test the probit noise model by writing\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> noiseTest('probit')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are several noise models implemented, the mains ones that are being maintained for the latest release are:\r\n\r\n`gaussian  ordered  probit  ncnm`\r\n\r\nThese noise models are Gaussian (standard Gaussian noise), probistic regression for binary classificaiton and ordered categorical for ordered categories (ordinal regression).\r\n\r\nPage updated on Tue Oct 6 17:28:55 2009\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"| [Disclaimer](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/documents/disclaimer/ \"Disclaimer\") | [Privacy](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/documents/privacy/ \"Privacy\") | [Copyright notice](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/documents/copyright/ \"Copyright Notice\") | [Accessibility](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/documents/accessibility/ \"Accessibility\") | [Freedom of information](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/documents/foi/ \"Freedom of information\") | [Feedback](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/feedback/ \"Feedback\") |  Please contact <webmaster.cs@manchester.ac.uk> with comments and suggestions","note":"Don't delete this file!
